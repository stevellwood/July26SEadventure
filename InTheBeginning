You had a dream about an overhead announcement at HQ.
It ordered everyone to gather their belongings and report to the parking lot....

You are laying in bed in a pool of sweat. You reach over to the counter to your phone to check out the "clock"...
and IFunny ... but it didn't make you laugh today.

Do you stay home, play sick? continue sleeping? or get up to face life with this ominous warning?
