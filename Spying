You drive to a lot across from the SSA.
There is no parking, but you manage to find the drone rental stand.
A drone rental for $180?
You've come this far, might as well?

While you drive in circles, you watch the drone camera on your dashboard.

You see that someone is having a big reception in the parking lot.
It appears to be a foreign delegation. They have covered the lot with sand so the 
delegation can pitch tents and ride in with camels.
You have real solid evidence to write a stern letter to the director.

You Win!
