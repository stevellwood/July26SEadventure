You arrive at headquarters, but find that someone has blocked off the parking lot for an official visit by ....someone.
The guards say everyone has to park off-grounds and find a bus.
You are furious. 
You see a strange man picketing the parking lot. His sign looks scary, but can't be read.
Do you give up and park at a distant commuter lot?
Or go see the strange man?
